              Programming Journey:
            </span>{' '}
            <br />
            My journey into programming began when I was in class seven and
            first discovered the internet. I was instantly captivated by the
            idea of creating something of my own on the web. While browsing
            various websites, I dreamt of building one myself, but at the time,
            I lacked the resources to make it happen. This limitation was
            disheartening, but it also fueled my determination. After completing
            my intermediate exams, I finally managed to buy a personal computer.
            That marked the true beginning of my programming exploration. I
            started as a self-learner with Python, but after 2.5 months of
            effort, I felt overwhelmed and frustrated.
            <br /> <br />
            Realizing I needed a clearer path, I shifted my focus to web
            development, diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However,
            progress was slow, and I struggled to advance further on my own.
            After a long period of trial and error, I decided to join a
            structured six-month web development course, and it was a turning
            point in my journey. The course reignited my passion and gave me a
            strong foundation. I learned key technologies such as HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and more.
            Now, I continue to explore the ever-evolving tech world with
            excitement and curiosity. My ultimate mission is to become a skilled
            full-stack developer, capable of bringing innovative ideas to life
            and making a meaningful impact in the digital realm.

              Hobby:
            </span>{' '}
            <br />
            I have a deep passion for reading, as it allows me to explore
            various perspectives, gain knowledge, and immerse myself in
            different worlds. During my free time, I enjoy delving into books
            across genres, with my favorites being The Alchemist by Paulo
            Coelho, Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey,
            and Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. These books inspire
            personal growth, offer timeless wisdom, and fuel my aspirations.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to reading, I love traveling. Exploring new places,
            experiencing diverse cultures, and embracing the beauty of nature
            bring me immense joy. Every journey adds a unique chapter to my
            lifeâ€™s story.
